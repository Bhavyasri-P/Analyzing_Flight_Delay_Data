Analyzing Flight Delay Data to Predict Future Delays

Introduction

Flight delays are a common challenge that disrupts travel plans, affects airline operations, and causes inconvenience to passengers. Predicting delays in advance can help improve scheduling, optimize airport operations, and reduce overall disruptions. This project aims to analyze past flight data and build a machine learning model to predict future delays.

Objective

The objective of this project is to use historical flight data to identify patterns in flight delays and develop a predictive model. The goal is to determine key factors contributing to delays and improve forecasting accuracy.

About the Dataset
	•	The dataset contains flight records from 2018 to April 2023.
	•	It includes information such as departure and arrival times, airline codes, flight distances, and delay reasons.
	•	The dataset consists of around 30 million records, making it ideal for large-scale analysis.

Dataset Source: [Kaggle] 

Code Overview

1. Importing Libraries and Setup
	•	Uses PySpark for handling large datasets efficiently.
	•	Configures Spark Session with appropriate memory and processing power.

2. Loading the Dataset
	•	Reads the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
	•	Due to memory limitations, a small sample (~30,000 records) is used for local testing.

3. Understanding the Data
	•	Analyzes column data types, missing values, and duplicates.
	•	Performs basic statistics to check distributions of delays and key factors.

4. Data Preprocessing
	•	Converts date columns into proper formats.
	•	Creates a TotalDelay column by summing Departure Delay and Arrival Delay.
	•	Maps airline and airport codes to their full names for better interpretation.

5. Feature Engineering
	•	Extracts day of the week and flight hour to study time-based delay trends.
	•	Adds weather conditions (if available) to analyze external delay factors.

6. Model Selection & Training
	•	Experiments with models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
	•	Splits the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.
	•	Selects the best model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. Model Evaluation
	•	Assesses model performance using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score.
	•	Identifies the most influential factors in predicting flight delays.

Conclusion

This project helps in understanding flight delays and predicting future delays using machine learning techniques. The insights gained can help airlines and airports enhance scheduling, improve efficiency, and minimize disruptions.
