Introduction

Flight delays are a common issue that affects passengers, airlines, and airports. Predicting delays in advance can help improve scheduling and reduce disruptions. This project analyzes past flight data and builds a machine learning model to predict future delays.
Objective

The main goal is to study flight delays and develop a model that can predict whether a flight will be delayed based on factors like airline, distance, time of day, and weather.
About the Dataset
	•	The dataset contains flight records from 2018 to April 2023.
	•	It includes details such as scheduled and actual times, airline codes, delay reasons, and flight distances.
	•	The dataset has around 30 million records, making it suitable for large-scale analysis.
Code Overview

1. Importing Libraries and Setup
	•	Uses PySpark to handle large datasets.
	•	Configures Spark Session for efficient processing.

2. Loading the Dataset
	•	Reads the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
	•	Due to memory limits, a small sample (~30,000 records) is used for local testing.

3. Understanding the Data
	•	Checks missing values, duplicate records, and column data types.
	•	Basic analysis to find average delays and common delay reasons.

4. Data Preprocessing
	•	Converts date columns to proper formats.
	•	Creates a new column for total delay time (Departure + Arrival Delay).
	•	Maps airline codes and airport codes to full names.

5. Feature Engineering
	•	Extracts day of the week and flight hour to analyze time-based patterns.
	•	Includes weather conditions (if available) to check impact on delays.

6. Model Selection & Training
	•	Tries different models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
	•	Splits data into 80% training and 20% testing.
	•	Selects the best model based on accuracy and F1-score.

7. Model Evaluation
	•	Checks precision, recall, and AUC score to measure prediction quality.
	•	Identifies which factors contribute most to flight delays.
